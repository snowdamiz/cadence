    Follow skills/project-overview/SKILL.md for exact behavior.
    Run scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --require-cadence --include-workflow-state, then use its JSON output for
    PROJECT_ROOT (project_root) and CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir).
    Never read or edit .cadence/cadence.json directly (including cat/rg/jq/Read); use Cadence scripts for all state reads and writes.
    Read overview data with scripts/run-project-overview.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT".
    Render output using the strict semantic hierarchy format defined in skills/project-overview/SKILL.md.
    Keep output essentials-only: progress, current position, next route, and full roadmap hierarchy.
    Use roadmap_display_source + roadmap_display_hierarchy from the script response.
    When source=planning render milestone -> phase only (planner v1 scope); when source=workflow render full milestone -> phase -> wave -> task nesting.
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --scope project-overview
    --checkpoint overview-reviewed --paths . (allow status=no_changes; treat failures as blocking).
    Keep replies concise and hide internal traces unless asked.
