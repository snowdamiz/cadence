    Follow skills/brownfield-documenter/SKILL.md for exact behavior and payload contract.
    Run scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --require-cadence, then use its JSON output for PROJECT_ROOT
    (project_root), CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir), and push/local-only mode (repo_enabled).
    Never read or edit .cadence/cadence.json directly (including cat/rg/jq/Read); use Cadence scripts for all state reads and writes.
    Enforce the strict user-facing response templates from skills/brownfield-documenter/SKILL.md.
    Run scripts/run-brownfield-documentation.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" discover, perform evidence-based
    analysis, then persist with scripts/run-brownfield-documentation.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" complete --stdin.
    Require a research_agenda with at least one topic, verify with scripts/get-ideation.py, and mention
    scripts/query-ideation-research.py for granular queries.
    End success with: Start a new chat with a new agent and say "research my project".
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --scope brownfield-documenter
    --checkpoint documentation-captured --paths . (allow status=no_changes; surface failures verbatim).
    Keep replies concise and hide internal traces unless asked.
