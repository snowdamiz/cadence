  short_description: "Read project state and route to the next Cadence phase"
  default_prompt: "Resolve PROJECT_ROOT first with scripts/resolve-project-root.py --require-cadence, then resolve CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR with scripts/resolve-project-scripts-dir.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\". Read workflow state using scripts/read-workflow-state.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\", report project progress, and if the user asks to continue/resume, automatically route using workflow.next_route from state. Run checkpoint commits from PROJECT_ROOT so git operations target the active project. Keep responses user-facing: summarize phase progress and next step without exposing raw workflow IDs, route paths, or command traces unless explicitly requested."
