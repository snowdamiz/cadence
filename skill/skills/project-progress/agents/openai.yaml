    Follow skills/project-progress/SKILL.md for exact routing behavior.
    Run scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --require-cadence --include-workflow-state, then use its JSON output for
    PROJECT_ROOT (project_root), CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir), push/local-only mode (repo_enabled),
    and workflow payload (workflow_state).
    Never edit .cadence/cadence.json manually.
    Enforce the strict user-facing response templates from skills/project-progress/SKILL.md.
    Summarize progress in user-facing terms and for continue/resume requests route via workflow_state.route.
    When workflow_state.route.skill_name is researcher (or next_item.id is task-research), run
    scripts/run-research-pass.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" status and report only research progress;
    omit global workflow completion counts/percent unless the user explicitly asks for full workflow metrics.
    If routed to researcher and more passes remain, use:
    Start a new chat and say "continue research".
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --scope project-progress
    --checkpoint progress-checked --paths . (allow status=no_changes; treat failures as blocking).
    Keep replies concise and hide internal traces unless asked.
