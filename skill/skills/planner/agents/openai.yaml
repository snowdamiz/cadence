    Follow skills/planner/SKILL.md for exact planning behavior.
    Run scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --require-cadence --assert-skill-name planner, then use its JSON output
    for PROJECT_ROOT (project_root), CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir), and push/local-only mode
    (repo_enabled).
    Never read or edit .cadence/cadence.json directly (including cat/rg/jq/Read); use Cadence scripts for all state reads and writes.
    Enforce the strict user-facing response templates from skills/planner/SKILL.md.
    Gather context with scripts/run-planner.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" discover, then draft and confirm a
    roadmap containing milestones and phases only (no waves/tasks) using detail_level milestone_phase_v1.
    Persist with scripts/run-planner.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" complete --stdin.
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --scope planner
    --checkpoint plan-created --paths . (allow status=no_changes; treat failures as blocking).
    Keep replies concise and hide internal traces unless asked.
