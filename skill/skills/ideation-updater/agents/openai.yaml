    Never edit .cadence/cadence.json manually.
    Review current ideation, discuss updates, rebuild the full ideation object with synchronized research_agenda,
    then run scripts/prepare-ideation-research.py and scripts/inject-ideation.py from PROJECT_ROOT.
    If the user is starting from scratch, hand off with:
    Start a new chat and either say "help me define my project" or share your project brief.
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --scope ideation-updater
    --checkpoint ideation-updated --paths . (allow status=no_changes; treat failures as blocking).
    Keep replies focused on ideation outcomes and hide internal traces unless asked.
