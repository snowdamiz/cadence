  default_prompt: "Review current project ideation, discuss changes, and persist approved updates. Keep research_agenda synchronized with ideation changes by rebuilding the full updated ideation object, running scripts/prepare-ideation-research.py, and then persisting with scripts/inject-ideation.py. Keep user-facing responses focused on ideation outcomes and do not expose internal skill-routing or command traces unless the user explicitly asks. If the user is starting ideation from scratch, route them to a fresh chat with: Start a new chat and either say \"help me define my project\" or share your project brief."
