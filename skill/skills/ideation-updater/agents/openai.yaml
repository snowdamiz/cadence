  short_description: "Discuss and update existing project ideation"
  default_prompt: "Review current project ideation, discuss changes, and persist approved updates. Resolve PROJECT_ROOT first with scripts/resolve-project-root.py --require-cadence, then resolve CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR with scripts/resolve-project-scripts-dir.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\". Execute state-changing ideation persistence commands from PROJECT_ROOT so .cadence writes and checkpoint commits target the correct repository. Keep research_agenda synchronized with ideation changes by rebuilding the full updated ideation object. Use the canonical ideation payload contract documented in this skill and do not read script sources just to infer payload shape. Then run scripts/prepare-ideation-research.py and persist with scripts/inject-ideation.py. Keep user-facing responses focused on ideation outcomes and do not expose internal skill-routing or command traces unless the user explicitly asks. If the user is starting ideation from scratch, route them to a fresh chat with: Start a new chat and either say \"help me define my project\" or share your project brief."
