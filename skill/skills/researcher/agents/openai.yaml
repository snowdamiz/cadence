  default_prompt: "Resolve PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/resolve-project-root.py --require-cadence, resolve CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR with scripts/resolve-project-scripts-dir.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\", run scripts/check-project-repo-status.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\" and treat repo_enabled as the authoritative push mode (false means local-only commits), and assert route using scripts/assert-workflow-route.py --skill-name researcher --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\". Run exactly one pass per conversation using scripts/run-research-pass.py start, research only that pass's topics with web-backed sources, then persist pass findings via scripts/run-research-pass.py complete. Never execute a second pass in the same chat. At end of a successful researcher conversation, run scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py from PROJECT_ROOT with --scope researcher --checkpoint research-pass-recorded --paths .; allow status=no_changes and treat checkpoint or push failures as blocking errors surfaced verbatim. If complete output indicates more work remains, end with: Start a new chat and say \"continue research\"."
