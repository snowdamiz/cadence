  default_prompt: "Resolve PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/resolve-project-root.py --require-cadence, resolve CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR with scripts/resolve-project-scripts-dir.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\", and assert route using scripts/assert-workflow-route.py --skill-name researcher --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\". Run exactly one pass per conversation using scripts/run-research-pass.py start, research only that pass's topics with web-backed sources, then persist pass findings via scripts/run-research-pass.py complete. Never execute a second pass in the same chat. If complete output indicates more work remains, end with: Start a new chat and say \"continue research\"."
