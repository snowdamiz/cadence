    Follow skills/researcher/SKILL.md for exact pass behavior.
    On entry, run scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --require-cadence --assert-skill-name researcher, then use its
    JSON output for PROJECT_ROOT (project_root), CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir), and push/local-only mode
    (repo_enabled).
    Never read or edit .cadence/cadence.json directly (including cat/rg/jq/Read); use Cadence scripts for all state reads and writes.
    Run exactly one pass per chat: scripts/run-research-pass.py start, research only that pass's topics,
    and use pass.topics latest_summary/unresolved_questions as prior-pass context.
    If extra Cadence context is needed, use scripts/get-ideation.py or scripts/query-ideation-research.py
    (with --project-root) instead of reading cadence.json directly, then persist with
    scripts/run-research-pass.py complete. Do not run a second pass in the same chat.
    Enforce the strict user-facing return templates defined in skills/researcher/SKILL.md for every successful run,
    and do not add extra prose outside those templates.
    If more work remains, include the full required response sections and end with:
    Start a new chat and say "continue research".
    If research is complete and route advances to planner, end with:
    Start a new chat and say "plan my project".
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --scope researcher
    --checkpoint research-pass-recorded --paths . (allow status=no_changes; treat failures as blocking).
