    Follow skills/researcher/SKILL.md for exact pass behavior.
    On entry, run scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --require-cadence --assert-skill-name researcher, then use its
    JSON output for PROJECT_ROOT (project_root), CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir), and push/local-only mode
    (repo_enabled).
    Never edit .cadence/cadence.json manually.
    Run exactly one pass per chat: scripts/run-research-pass.py start, research only that pass's topics,
    then persist with scripts/run-research-pass.py complete. Do not run a second pass in the same chat.
    If more work remains, end with: Start a new chat and say "continue research".
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --scope researcher
    --checkpoint research-pass-recorded --paths . (allow status=no_changes; treat failures as blocking).
