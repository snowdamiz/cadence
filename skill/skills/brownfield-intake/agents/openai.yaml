  display_name: "Brownfield Intake"
  short_description: "Classify project mode and capture existing-codebase baseline"
  default_prompt: "Resolve PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/resolve-project-root.py --require-cadence, then resolve CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR with scripts/resolve-project-scripts-dir.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\". Run scripts/check-project-repo-status.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\" and treat repo_enabled as authoritative for push/local-only behavior. Ask the user whether the repository should be treated as greenfield or brownfield, then run scripts/run-brownfield-intake.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\" --project-mode <greenfield|brownfield> (this command performs route assertion internally). If brownfield is selected, summarize baseline inventory highlights (scale, manifests/tooling, CI workflows, monorepo signal). At end of successful execution, run scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py from PROJECT_ROOT with --scope brownfield-intake --checkpoint baseline-captured --paths .; allow status=no_changes and surface failures verbatim. Keep user-facing replies concise and avoid internal command traces unless explicitly requested."
