  short_description: "Run and persist Cadence prerequisite checks for Python availability"
  default_prompt: "Run Cadence prerequisite checks, verify Python availability, and persist pass state before lifecycle or delivery execution. Resolve PROJECT_ROOT first with scripts/resolve-project-root.py --require-cadence, then resolve CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR with scripts/resolve-project-scripts-dir.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\". Before running prerequisite actions, assert route with scripts/assert-workflow-route.py --skill-name prerequisite-gate --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\" and stop on mismatch. Execute checkpoint commit commands from PROJECT_ROOT so git operations target the active project. Keep user-facing messages focused on prerequisite outcomes and avoid internal command/routing traces unless explicitly requested."
