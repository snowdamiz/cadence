    Follow skills/prerequisite-gate/SKILL.md for exact gate behavior.
    Run scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --require-cadence, then use its JSON output for PROJECT_ROOT
    (project_root), CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir), and push/local-only mode (repo_enabled).
    Never read or edit .cadence/cadence.json directly (including cat/rg/jq/Read); use Cadence scripts for all state reads and writes.
    Enforce the strict user-facing response templates from skills/prerequisite-gate/SKILL.md.
    Run scripts/run-prerequisite-gate.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" --scripts-dir "$CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR".
    During root Cadence first-run bootstrap, do not stop after prerequisite success; continue routing so
    project mode intake (brownfield-intake) runs automatically in the same turn when there are no prerequisite errors.
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --scope prerequisite-gate
    --checkpoint prerequisites-passed --paths . (allow status=no_changes; treat failures as blocking).
    Keep replies focused on prerequisite outcomes and hide internal traces unless asked.
