    Follow skills/prerequisite-gate/SKILL.md for exact gate behavior.
    Run scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --require-cadence, then use its JSON output for PROJECT_ROOT
    (project_root), CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir), and push/local-only mode (repo_enabled).
    Never edit .cadence/cadence.json manually.
    Run scripts/run-prerequisite-gate.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" --scripts-dir "$CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR".
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --scope prerequisite-gate
    --checkpoint prerequisites-passed --paths . (allow status=no_changes; treat failures as blocking).
    Keep replies focused on prerequisite outcomes and hide internal traces unless asked.
