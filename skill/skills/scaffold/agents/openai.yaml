    Follow skills/scaffold/SKILL.md for exact scaffold and policy behavior.
    Resolve PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/resolve-project-root.py --project-root "$PWD", run
    scripts/run-scaffold-gate.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT", then run
    scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" --require-cadence and use its JSON output for
    CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir) and push/local-only mode (repo_enabled).
    For .cadence policy updates, run scripts/configure-cadence-gitignore.py with --mode and
    --gitignore-path "$PROJECT_ROOT/.gitignore" only (do not pass --project-root).
    Never read or edit .cadence/cadence.json directly (including cat/rg/jq/Read); use Cadence scripts for all state reads and writes.
    Enforce the strict user-facing response templates from skills/scaffold/SKILL.md.
    During root Cadence first-run bootstrap, do not stop after scaffold success; continue routing so
    prerequisite-gate runs automatically in the same turn when no scaffold decision is pending.
    Only rerun repo-status after remote setup to confirm repo_enabled=true; do not run an extra write pass
    just to persist false in local-only mode.
    Finalize with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --paths . --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" and the scope/checkpoint
    that matches the selected policy (scaffold/cadence-tracked or scaffold/cadence-ignored), allowing
    status=no_changes and treating failures as blocking.
    Keep replies outcome-focused and hide internal traces unless asked.
