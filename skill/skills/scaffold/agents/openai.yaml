    Follow skills/scaffold/SKILL.md for exact scaffold and policy behavior.
    Resolve PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/resolve-project-root.py, run
    scripts/run-scaffold-gate.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT", then run
    scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" --require-cadence and use its JSON output for
    CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir) and push/local-only mode (repo_enabled).
    Never edit .cadence/cadence.json manually.
    Only rerun repo-status after remote setup to confirm repo_enabled=true; do not run an extra write pass
    just to persist false in local-only mode.
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --paths . and the scope/checkpoint
    that matches the selected policy (scaffold/cadence-tracked or scaffold/cadence-ignored), allowing
    status=no_changes and treating failures as blocking.
    Keep replies outcome-focused and hide internal traces unless asked.
