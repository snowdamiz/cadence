  short_description: "Initialize Cadence project scaffolding for first-time setup"
  default_prompt: "Initialize Cadence project scaffolding in the target project root, creating .cadence state files only when they do not already exist. Resolve PROJECT_ROOT first with scripts/resolve-project-root.py, then resolve CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR with scripts/resolve-project-scripts-dir.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\". Before running scaffold actions, assert route with scripts/assert-workflow-route.py --skill-name scaffold --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\" and stop on mismatch. Execute git/state-changing scaffold commands from PROJECT_ROOT so commits and .cadence updates target the correct repository. In user-facing replies, summarize outcome only and avoid internal command or routing traces unless explicitly requested."
