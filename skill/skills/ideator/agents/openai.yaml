  default_prompt: "Guide the user from a rough concept or provided project brief to a fully defined idea. Before ideation steps, assert the workflow route with scripts/assert-workflow-route.py --skill-name ideator and stop on mismatch. Ask one follow-up question at a time for missing critical details, then produce a complete domain-agnostic research agenda inferred from the ideation discussion with blocks, topics, and entity relationships. Before persistence, run scripts/prepare-ideation-research.py to normalize and validate the research agenda, then inject via scripts/inject-ideation.py. Keep user-facing responses focused on ideation outcomes and do not expose internal skill-routing or command traces unless explicitly requested."
