    Follow skills/ideator/SKILL.md and its ideation payload contract.
    On entry, run scripts/run-skill-entry-gate.py --require-cadence --assert-skill-name ideator, then use its JSON
    output for PROJECT_ROOT (project_root), CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR (cadence_scripts_dir), and push/local-only mode
    (repo_enabled).
    Never read or edit .cadence/cadence.json directly (including cat/rg/jq/Read); use Cadence scripts for all state reads and writes.
    Enforce the strict user-facing response templates from skills/ideator/SKILL.md.
    Ask one question at a time, build an execution-ready ideation object and complete research_agenda,
    then from PROJECT_ROOT rerun route assertion, run scripts/prepare-ideation-research.py,
    and persist with scripts/inject-ideation.py.
    End successful completion with: Start a new chat with a new agent and say "research my project".
    Finalize from PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py --scope ideator
    --checkpoint ideation-completed --paths . (allow status=no_changes; treat failures as blocking).
    Keep replies focused on ideation outcomes and hide internal traces unless asked.
