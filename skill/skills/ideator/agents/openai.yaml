  default_prompt: "Guide the user from a rough concept or provided project brief to a fully defined idea. Resolve PROJECT_ROOT first with scripts/resolve-project-root.py --require-cadence, then resolve CADENCE_SCRIPTS_DIR with scripts/resolve-project-scripts-dir.py --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\". Before ideation steps, assert route with scripts/assert-workflow-route.py --skill-name ideator --project-root \"$PROJECT_ROOT\" and stop on mismatch. Execute state-changing ideation persistence commands from PROJECT_ROOT so .cadence writes and checkpoint commits target the correct project. Ask one follow-up question at a time for missing critical details, then produce a complete domain-agnostic research agenda inferred from the ideation discussion with blocks, topics, and entity relationships. Before persistence, run scripts/prepare-ideation-research.py to normalize and validate the research agenda, then inject via scripts/inject-ideation.py. Keep user-facing responses focused on ideation outcomes and do not expose internal skill-routing or command traces unless explicitly requested."
