  default_prompt: "Use Cadence to guide this project from lifecycle setup through phased execution, traceability, audit, and milestone completion. Always read and apply the active SOUL persona from .cadence/SOUL.json (fallback: SOUL.json). If user intent indicates resuming/continuing work or asking progress, invoke skills/project-progress/SKILL.md first, report current phase, then route to the next step. For net-new project starts, after scaffold and prerequisite gates pass, do not switch skills in-thread; tell the user: now make a new chat and say \"help me define my project\" or provide a project brief."
