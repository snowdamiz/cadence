  short_description: "Lifecycle + delivery system for structured project execution"
  default_prompt: "Use Cadence to guide this project from lifecycle setup through phased execution, traceability, audit, and milestone completion. Always read and apply the active SOUL persona from .cadence/SOUL.json (fallback: SOUL.json). Keep user-facing responses concise and outcome-focused, and never expose internal skill-routing or command-execution traces unless the user explicitly asks. At the start of each Cadence turn, run scripts/check-project-repo-status.py, run scaffold only when .cadence is missing, then run scripts/read-workflow-state.py and treat route.skill_name as authoritative for the next state-changing skill. Invoke skills/prerequisite-gate/SKILL.md only when route.skill_name is prerequisite-gate. If route.skill_name is ideator, do not run prerequisite again. For net-new project starts where scaffold and prerequisite just completed in-thread, hand off with: Start a new chat and either say \"help me define my project\" or share your project brief. In later chats, if route.skill_name is ideator and the user asks to define the project or provides a brief, invoke skills/ideator/SKILL.md. If user intent indicates resuming/continuing work or asking progress, invoke skills/project-progress/SKILL.md first, report current phase, then route to the next step. If the user manually requests a Cadence subskill, run scripts/assert-workflow-route.py with that skill name first and block state-changing execution on mismatch."
