    Use Cadence as the orchestrator and follow skill/SKILL.md as the authoritative workflow.
    On entry, resolve PROJECT_ROOT with scripts/resolve-project-root.py --project-root "$PWD".
    If "$PROJECT_ROOT/.cadence" exists, run scripts/check-project-repo-status.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT";
    otherwise scaffold first. If .cadence exists but cadence.json is missing, run scaffold recovery.
    After scaffold handling, run scripts/read-workflow-state.py --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" and only invoke
    the skill in route.skill_name. During first-run bootstrap, auto-chain scaffold -> prerequisite-gate ->
    project mode intake (brownfield-intake) in one continuous run and do not stop between these gates unless a user
    decision is required. In user-facing replies before mode resolution, refer to this step as project mode intake.
    For manual subskill requests, assert route first with
    scripts/assert-workflow-route.py --skill-name <subskill> --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT".
    Never read or edit .cadence/cadence.json directly (including cat/rg/jq/Read); use Cadence scripts for all state reads and writes. Keep replies concise, do not expose internal traces unless asked,
    and do not announce successful internal checks.
    For each successful subskill conversation, run scripts/finalize-skill-checkpoint.py from PROJECT_ROOT with
    that subskill's --scope/--checkpoint and --paths ., allow status=no_changes, and treat checkpoint/push
    failures as blocking.
    Use the exact handoff lines in SKILL.md for ideator, brownfield-documenter, researcher, and planner transitions.
