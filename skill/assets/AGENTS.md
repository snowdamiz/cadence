## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One tack per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: record the lesson inside `.cadence/cadence.json` (for example `project-details.lessons`)
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project
- Do not create ad-hoc tracking files like `.cadence/tasks/*`

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

### 7. User-Facing Hygiene
- Keep user-facing messages outcome-focused
- Do not expose internal routing, command traces, terminal transcripts, or timing metadata unless the user explicitly asks
- Never manually edit `.cadence/cadence.json`; use Cadence scripts for all state updates

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: track plan state in `.cadence/cadence.json` workflow items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: update workflow item status as work advances
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: persist structured results in `.cadence/cadence.json`
6. **Capture Lessons**: update `.cadence/cadence.json` only

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
- **Script-Only State Writes**: `.cadence/cadence.json` must only be changed via existing Cadence scripts.
